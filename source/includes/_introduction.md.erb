## Editing this documentation

> Installing doc dependencies

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

This documentation's source code is found in the [uqmc/docs](https://github.com/uqmc/docs/) repository. The repository is a fork of [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/). To edit its content, simply clone our 'docs' repository and edit the markdown files under `source/`. The `index.html.md` file includes the front-matter for the markdown. Within the front-matter we define which other markdown files are included as part of the 'includes' array. These includable files are located in `source/includes` and are appended to the main markdown file in the same order they are enumerated in the index's frontmatter.

There are also global variables defined in the `config.yml` which can be used within the markdown files. Items subject to change, such as domains and peoples' names, should be defined here.

The [Slate wiki](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki) has heaps of resources on how to customise, run, and deploy the documentation.

To recap, the main files/directories you need to edit are:

 - `source/index.html.md`    
 - `source/includes/`    
 - `config.yml`

### Development

> Running the docs locally

```bash
$ bundle exec middleman server
```

This will spin up a local server at `http://localhost:4567/` that will automatically update as you make changes to the documentation source.

### Production

> Deploying docs to production

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Make changes"
$ git push
```

In order to deploy your changes to production, simply run the commands on the right. Changes made on the `main` branch will automatically be built and moved to the `gh-pages` branch (through GitHub Actions). The `gh-pages` branch is where GitHub Pages looks for files to deploy publically.

### Little extra

If you are editing the docs with VSCode, you can hide all files besides those that you need to edit by adding [this glob](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vardy/3095f3c9a8e3e7d20201ca3bdbac8e59/raw/e3b230f7a922bb48bfac79af047e3d4d2863dbe1/hide_slate_files_glob.txt#) to the `files:excludes` setting.
