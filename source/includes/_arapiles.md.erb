# Arapiles

## Arapiles tasks

```
[ ] Copy: proof-read body text
[ ] Content: map image to show where club activities take place
```

**Body text**

Import copy that execs provide. Proof-read and type nicely.

**Map**

A screenshot of Google Maps with annotations on how to get to where we setup at KP will do.

```
[x] Deploy: documentation
[x] Deploy: arapiles
[ ] CI/Deploy: update docker-compose files to use Docker Hub images 
[ ] CI/Deploy: upload to Docker Hub
[ ] Networking: figure out service networking for production and development
```

**Arapiles deployment**

Arapiles needs to be deployed to a VPS, tested, and then the A name records for the uqmc.org DNS needs to point to the VPS IP.

```
[ ] Code: add config class for environment variables
[ ] Code: setup env vars for production/deployment properly
[ ] Code: start using Strapi content on front-end
[ ] Code: add blog section
```

**Config class**

The config class should be based off the exemplar in [uqmc/girraween](https://github.com/uqmc/Girraween/blob/master/src/config.py).

```
[ ] Documentation: add py doc strings
[ ] Documentaiton: document processes in uqmc/docs
```

**Doc strings**

The doc strings should be for all functions and any unclear functionality that adheres to a unified style defined in these docs' [style section](#style).

```
[x] Styling: page layout
[ ] Styling: page layout with Ant.Design grid
[x] Styling: font
[x] Styling: nav bar
[ ] Styling: sticky nav bar on scroll with JS
[ ] Styling: static 'to-top' button when scrolled past nav bar
[ ] Styling: style homepage with Figma design
```

**Layout with grid**

Using [Ant Design's grid](https://ant.design/components/grid/) layout we need to achieve the same layout as we currently have. It should be mobile-responsive.

**Sticky nav bar**

When the viewport scrolls past the navbar, a new, smaller bar should appear and be sticky to the top of the viewport. It should appear with a subtle animation. To do this, a simple JS script will suffice.

**Styling homepage with figma design**

The design as seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UXejHbkGsAnlS3U6JN0PMi/Colour2?node-id=0%3A1) should be implemented.

```
[ ] Legal: licensing image assets in source
[ ] Legal: add copyright headers to project files
```

**Asset licensing**

All assets (images, videos, etc.) used in the Arapiles project should be licensed with UQMC's exclusive copyright.

**Copyright headers**

Headers should be based on the Apache-2.0 license header template.
