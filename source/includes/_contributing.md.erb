# Contributing

Contributing to the codebase may be a bit daunting at first. This documentation will seek to be as descriptive as possible without re-inventing the wheel. Google is our best friend here!

To contribute please familiarise yourself with [Git](https://youtu.be/hwP7WQkmECE) and check out the [GitHub organisation]() for all of the projects' source code.

Details for each project can be found in their respective documentation section and an overview of our architecture and each project can be found in the [architecture section](#architecture). For more information please message the exec currently in charge of maintaining club technology.

## Tasks

To-do items can be found on the [Trello board](<%= config[:url_trello] %>).
