# Contributing

Contributing to the code-base may be a bit daunting at first. This documentation will seek to be as descriptive as possible without re-inventing the wheel. Google is our best friend here!

This contributing section is targetted towards members of the community looking to help out who do not have administrative privledges in the GitHub organisation.

## What to change

If you want to help out but don't know where to start, check out the 'Tasks' headings in these docs. There are lists of todo items for each project. Pick one that looks fun to you and start hacking away! Feel free to ask questions.

Don't worry about messing up - all code will be reviewed before it makes its way into the projects' live versions.
