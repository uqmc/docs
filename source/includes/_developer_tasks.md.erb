# Tasks (Arapiles)

```
[ ] Copy: proof-read body text
[ ] Content: map image to show where club activities take place
```

**Body text**

Import copy that execs provide. Proof-read and type nicely.

**Map**

A screenshot of Google Maps with annotations on how to get to where we setup at KP will do.

```
[x] Deploy: documentation
[ ] Deploy: Arapiles
```

**Arapiles deployment**

Arapiles needs to be deployed to a VPS, tested, and then the A name records for the uqmc.org DNS needs to point to the VPS IP.

```
[x] Styling: page layout
[ ] Styling: page layout with Ant.Design grid
[x] Styling: font
[x] Styling: nav bar
[ ] Styling: sticky nav bar on scroll with JS
```

**Layout with grid**

Using [Ant Design's grid](https://ant.design/components/grid/) layout we need to achieve the same layout as we currently have. It should be mobile-responsive.

**Sticky nav bar**

When the viewport scrolls past the navbar, a new, smaller bar should appear and be sticky to the top of the viewport. It should appear with a subtle animation. To do this, a simple JS script will suffice.
